# Smart-Route-Optimizer-for-Food-Delivery

# 🚀 Smart Route Optimizer for Food Delivery  
A DSA-based project that helps find the **fastest delivery route** between any two city locations using **Graphs** and **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** in Java.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world food delivery scenario like **Swiggy/Zomato** and determines the **shortest delivery path** based on traffic weights and distances.

It uses:
- Graph Data Structure  
- Priority Queue  
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm  
- Adjacency List Representation  

---

## 🚴 Features
- Find the fastest route between locations  
- Dynamic path calculation  
- Weighted graph (traffic/distance considered)  
- Uses Priority Queue to speed up Dijkstra  
- Clean, modular Java design  

---

## 🧠 DSA Concepts Used
- **Graph (Adjacency List)**  
- **Edge Representation**  
- **Priority Queue (Min-Heap)**  
- **Dijkstra Shortest Path Algorithm**  
- **Maps & Lists**

## 🧪 Example Input / Output

**Input:**
```
Enter your delivery start location:
Restaurant

Enter delivery destination:
Customer
```

**Output:**
```
🚴 Shortest Delivery Distance:
From Restaurant to Customer: 8 minutes
```

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Install **Java 8+**
2. Put all `.java` files in the same folder
3. Compile:
```
javac *.java
```
4. Run:
```
java Main
```

## 🛠️ Future Enhancements
- Real-time traffic updates  
- GUI interface  
- Multiple delivery boy routing  
- A* algorithm support  
- Map visualization
